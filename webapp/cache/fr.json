\n- A very wide and atomized range of highly specialized applications, each targeting a specific topic (english, maths) and/or a specific use case (smart cards, multiple choice questions).\n\n### The Vision\n\n- What if there was a more engaging and fun way to practise than black & white forms to fill in?\n- What if students could practice and assess their knowledge anytime anywhere without carrying heavy books?\n- What if students could get instant corrections without involving teachers and parents?\n- What if parents could provide as many exercises as their children require to master any topics?\n- What if teachers could spend less time correcting assessments and more time actually teaching face-to-face? \n- What if any effort to build new exercises could be shared and re-used by others again and again?\n- What if a single application could cover any topics for any age groups?\n- What if schools could spare the burden and cost of photocopies?\n\nThis is our vision for Kidoju.","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"Vision for Kidoju","icon":"astrologer","keywords":"Memba, Kidoju, Quizlet, Khan Academy, education, tablets, teach, learn, knowledge, quiz, test, revision, practice","language":"en","title":"Vision for Kidoju","creation_date":"2016-04-05T05:26:53Z","uuid":"25d5e250-faef-11e5-bcae-db81d8040de2","author":"jlchereau","author_url":"https://github.com/jlchereau","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2556751?v=3","edit_url":"https://github.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/blob/master/fr/posts/2014/vision.md","site_url":"https://www.kidoju.com/support/fr/posts/2016/04/vision","path":"fr/posts/2014/vision.md"}]
