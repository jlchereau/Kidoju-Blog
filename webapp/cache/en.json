student-produced answer with the teacher-designed solution.\nConsidering this design, our system could also host mind games like sudokus and crosswords since the comparison between an answer and a

It always starts with a vision\n\n### The Context\n\nKidoju started in the UK at the end of 2013 with two of my children respectively practising their 11+ and SAT tests.\n\nMy daughter's teachers would provide her with tons of photocopied practise tests and she would regularly ask me to derive\nsimilar exercises to help her check her comprehension of the correction and practise again after failing a question. \n\nMy son purchased a large collection of SAT practice tests from Barron's, CollegeBoard, Kaplan, Princeton Review and others\nbut any of these books would be far to bulky to carry in order to practise during transportation or lunch time.\n\nBeing a mobile device enthusiast, I have naturally turned to iTunes to find education material to assist them in their revisions.\n\nStill today, driving theory tests, brain games and foreign language learning make the top grossing education apps on iTunes\nand the **school toolkit** recommended by Apple is essentially made of productivity apps:\n\n![iTunes school toolkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/master/en/posts/2014/vision.png)\n\nIn fact, there are very few decent mobile apps to comprehensively support our children's education through their curriculum.\nQuizlet and Khan Academy are certainly among them but none can be considered as a replacement for classroom photocopied exercises.  \n\n### The Market\n\nThe education software market is actually divided into three main categories:\n\n- [Learning Management Systems (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) help schools and universities manage students, teachers and classes;\n- [Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) expand access to education by providing online video courses; \n- A very wide and atomized range of highly specialized applications, each targeting a specific topic (english, maths) and/or a specific use case (smart cards, multiple choice questions).\n\n### The Vision\n\n- What if there was a more engaging and fun way to practise than black & white forms to fill in?\n- What if students could practice and assess their knowledge anytime anywhere without carrying heavy books?\n- What if students could get instant corrections without involving teachers and parents?\n- What if parents could provide as many exercises as their children require to master any topics?\n- What if teachers could spend less time correcting assessments and more time actually teaching face-to-face? \n- What if any effort to build new exercises could be shared and re-used by others again and again?\n- What if a single application could cover any topics for any age groups?\n- What if schools could spare the burden and cost of photocopies?\n\nThis is our vision for Kidoju.","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"Vision for

Technical requirements\n\nOur technical requirements were the following:\n\n1. web and mobile applications (common code);\n2. rich user interface (drag and drop);\n3. cloud deployment and scalability (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google App Engine);\n4. one-click deployment, ideally with continuous integration.\n\nand more specifically:\n\n1. database support for full-text indexing;\n2. storage of multimedia files;\n3. RESTful API feeding both the web and mobile applications;\n4. oAuth logins integrated with Facebook, Google and Twitter among others;\n5. a rich library of HTML controls;\n6. code-factoring between web and mobile for potability across devices and operating systems.\n\n## Prototypes\n\nWe did two server prototypes inplementing oAuth logins and a RESTful API for CRUD operations:\n\n1. A [Microsoft ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) application with a [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) backend,\n2. A MEAN ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), [expressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [angularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)) application with a NoSQL backend.  \n\nWe did three client prototypes implementing drawing, dragging, dropping, translating, scaling, rotating all kinds of components including text, images, videos:\n\n1. an SVG-based prototype using [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/);\n2. a Canvas-based prototype using [CreateJS](http://www.createjs.com/);\n3. an HTML-based prototype using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/);\n\nand we ran them in various browsers and in a [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) environement.\n\nThe client prototypes also used HTML control libraries including [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/), [Telerik Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui),\n[GrapeCity Wijmo](http://wijmo.com/) and [Infragistics Ignite UI](http://www.igniteui.com/) \n\n## Weighing our options\n\n// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> TODO: Add MEAN Logo Here\n\nAlthough we enjoyed C# compilation and the ability of [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) and [Entity Framework](http://www.asp.net/entity-framework)\nto automatically present a uniform interface for [content negotiation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn574797.aspx),\nthe MEAN stack proved much more scalable, versatile and easily debuggable (end-to-end JavaScript).\n\nUsing the MEAN stack, we naturally turned to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [dockerized containers](https://www.docker.com/) for deployment.\n\nTelerik Kendo UI was definitely the richest HTML control framework at the time and we did not retain angularJS in our MEAN stack\nbecause Kendo UI includes data-binding and routing and because AngularJS 2 was planned to break compatibility with AngularJS 1.\n\nConsidering an SVG interface to design quizzes was inspired by the likes of [SVG-Edit](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html).\nAlthough RaphaelJS made vector drawing, dragging and dropping very easy, a simple textbox proved to be a challenge especially to trigger the keyboard on mobile devices.\nConsidering most browsers do not support the ```<foreignObject>``` tag to embed HTML within SVG, some widgets like form controls and videos would have required an HTML layer on top of SVG.\n\nConsidering a canvas interface to design quizzes was inspired by Adobe Edge Animate CC among [other editors](https://www.picozu.com/editor/) and the idea of gamification in education. \nCreateJS is like RaphaelJS but targets the HTML ```<canvas>``` with a focus on complex animations.\nCreateJS offers the benefit to manage an [HTML layer on top of the canvas](http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/DOMElement.html).\nLike RaphaelJS, CreateJS would make drawing, dragging and dropping very easy, and the ability to include HTML components, although still experimental in version 0.82, would have filled the gap\nto display form controls and video. Note that canvas is for rasterized images, but CreateJS offers the ability to keep a display list of text, shapes, bitmaps and DOM elements.\n\nAlthough jQuery offers a uniform API across browsers, HTML elements are much more difficult to style, position, size and rotate properly due to margins, padding, and else.\nAlso drawing lines and shapes on an HTML stage is not possible without involving a canvas or an svg surface so we were going in circles.\nWe needed both HTML and a drawing surface (SVG or canvas). The question was which should be our primary target?\nWe took a step back to figure out what type of bricks could be considered to make our highly interactive quizzes in addition to the obvious text, audio and video widgets:\n\n- we definitely needed all types of form controls including textboxes, checkboxes, option groups and drop-down lists, and there was no point redeveloping them for a canvas or SVG surface;\n- we could also consider tapping into all sorts of Javascript controls, including [mathematic formulas](https://www.mathjax.org/), [charts](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/bar-charts/index),\n[spreadsheets](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/spreadsheet/index) or else.\n\nDrawing lines and shapes was definitely a secondary objective and HTML was our first target.\nIn other words, from a technical perspective, our highly interactive quizzes are a collection of HTML components.\nDrawing surfaces are only one type of quiz components whether they are drawn with RaphaelJS, CreateJS, D3, MathJax or any other JavaScript library that best fits requirements.","category":"Developer","description":"Kidoju has a micro-services architecture based on the MEAN stack.","icon":"server_client","keywords":"architecture, web, mobile, Phonegap, MEAN, MongoDB, node, nodeJS, express, expressJS, angular, angularJS, jQuery, Telerik, Kendo, Kendo UI, docker, Amazon, REST, API","language":"en","title":"Technical architecture","creation_date":"2016-01-15T10:32:22Z","uuid":"27bf89e0-faef-11e5-af20-a53f004f8aa7","author":"jlchereau","author_url":"https://github.com/jlchereau","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2556751?v=3","edit_url":"https://github.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/blob/master/en/posts/2015/architecture.md","site_url":"https://www.kidoju.com/support/en/posts/2016/01/architecture","path":"en/posts/2015/architecture.md"},{"text":"Explain the various layers:\n- server api\n- rapi\n- models\n- etc.","category":"Miscellaneous","description":"Application design.","icon":"index2","keywords":"architecture, web, mobile, Phonegap, MEAN, MongoDB, node, nodeJS, express, expressJS, angular, angularJS, jQuery, Telerik, Kendo, Kendo UI, docker, Amazon, REST, API","language":"en","title":"Functional requirements","creation_date":"2016-04-05T05:26:53Z","uuid":"27db7650-faef-11e5-af20-a53f004f8aa7","author":"jlchereau","author_url":"https://github.com/jlchereau","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2556751?v=3","edit_url":"https://github.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/blob/master/en/posts/2015/design.md","site_url":"https://www.kidoju.com/support/en/posts/2016/04/design","path":"en/posts/2015/design.md"},{"text":"Link to a sample\n\n1024x768\n\nH = scale * 768 + 44px\nW = scale * 1024","category":"Developer","description":"TODO","icon":"document_cup","keywords":"Memba, Kidoju, Quizlet, Socrative, Khan Academy, education, tablets, teach, learn, knowledge, quiz, test, revision, practice","language":"en","title":"How to embed a Kidoju in your web site or blog?","uuid":"27fa9710-faef-11e5-af20-a53f004f8aa7","author":"jlchereau","author_url":"https://github.com/jlchereau","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2556751?v=3","creation_date":"2016-04-05T05:26:53Z","edit_url":"https://github.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/blob/master/en/posts/2016/iframe.md","site_url":"https://www.kidoju.com/support/en/posts/2016/04/iframe","path":"en/posts/2016/iframe.md"},{"text":"","category":"User","description":"Title, description and tags are important metadata to index Kidojus and display relevant social network share dialogs.","icon":"index2","keywords":"Memba, Kidoju, Quizlet, Socrative, Khan Academy, education, tablets, teach, learn, knowledge, quiz, test, revision, practice","language":"en","title":"Why title description and tags are important?","uuid":"281ff960-faef-11e5-af20-a53f004f8aa7","author":"jlchereau","author_url":"https://github.com/jlchereau","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2556751?v=3","creation_date":"2016-04-05T05:26:53Z","edit_url":"https://github.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/blob/master/en/posts/2016/indexing.md","site_url":"https://www.kidoju.com/support/en/posts/2016/04/indexing","path":"en/posts/2016/indexing.md"}]
